                            <p>Since we are in active development small outages might still occur. Please try to reconnect again after 1 minute or more. If this is not working have a quick look at <a href="https://bywire.news">bywire.news</a>. If our webpage loads fine please check the email with your publisher credentials. For security reasons the plugin just mentions if there is a problem with either the username or password. However we are happy to help if these obvious fixes are of no use, please contact the development team at jetze@bywire.news.</p>
